# Remote

## Check if the object exists in s3 before uploading again
## Attach a file validity header to the put request

## Fetch remote objects
I have the remote db being fetched down and I can use that to diff a subsequent
push, but there isn't the fetch down of the remote data to sync up.

# Branch
## Get branching working
I already have refs working, at this point, it's just a matter of adding the
various branch commands.
