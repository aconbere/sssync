## Get branching working

I already have refs working, at this point, it's just a matter of adding the
various branch commands.

## Print the current branch name in status

Just do it

## Remote Fetch

## Meta::HEAD

Meeds a way to know if the head is a branch or a commit

## Add a hash type to each hash for future upgrades
